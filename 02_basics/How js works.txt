JavaScript Execution Context 

1. Global Execution Context
2. Function Execution Context
3. Eval Execution Context

Two Phases in which Javascript Code Runs 

1. Memory Creation Phase 
2. Execution Phase

How a Javascript code is executed?

1. Any Bigger or Smller code is run from Global Execution Context and is allocated under this
2. Memory Creation phase : stores all variables and all variables and functions are undefined
3. Execution Phase : Values of the variables are allocated
Every Time new function is called;  a new varibale enviornment + execution Thread is allocated ; that is just like Global Scope , whole new enviornment is created for Local Scope and gets deleted when the it's work is done

  3.0 Local Scope for function gets New Variable env + execution thread . So, 
  3.1. Memory Phase : val1 ---> undefined ; val2 ---> undefined ; total ---> undefined 
  3.2. Execution Context : values to val1 , val2 , total
